# My_projects
These are the projects that I completed learning how to become a software developer
These are just the completed projects from FreeCodeCamp and other certificate programs. Please be kind and understand that I am still trying to learn software engineering and hoping that one day this can be a viable option for a career. Any suggestions are always welcomed and if you have any questions about why I did something please feel free to contact me! 
Thank you and I hope you enjoy what I've done so far.
